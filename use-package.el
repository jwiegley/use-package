;;; Commentary:

;; The `use-package' declaration macro allows you to isolate package
;; configuration in your ".emacs" in a way that is performance-oriented and,
;; well, just tidy.  I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use
;; in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage.  Yet with this
;; utility my total load time is just under 1 second, with no loss of
;; functionality!
;;
;; Please see README.md from the same repository for documentation.

;;; Code:

(require 'use-package-core)

(require 'use-package-bind-key)
(require 'use-package-diminish)
(require 'use-package-delight)
(require 'use-package-ensure)
(require 'use-package-hydra)

(declare-function use-package-jump-to-package-form "use-package-jump")
(autoload #'use-package-jump-to-package-form "use-package-jump" nil t)

(provide 'use-package)

;;; use-package.el ends here
