;;; Commentary:

;; The `use-package' declaration macro allows you to isolate package
;; configuration in your ".emacs" in a way that is performance-oriented and,
;; well, just tidy.  I created it because I have over 80 packages that I use
;; in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage.  Yet with this
;; utility my total load time is just under 1 second, with no loss of
;; functionality!
;;
;; Here is the simplest `use-package' declaration:
;;
;;   (use-package foo)
;;
;; This loads in the package foo, but only if foo is available on your system.
;; If not, a warning is logged to your `*Messages*' buffer.  If it succeeds a
;; message about "Loading foo" is logged, along with the time it took to load,
;; if that time is over 0.01s.
;;
;; Use the :init keywoard to do some stuff to initialize foo, but only if foo
;; actually gets loaded:
;;
;;   (use-package foo
;;     :init
;;     (progn
;;       (setq foo-variable t)
;;       (foo-mode 1)))
;;
;; A very common thing to do when loading a module is to bind a key to primary
;; commands within that module:
;;
;;   (use-package ace-jump-mode
;;     :bind ("C-." . ace-jump-mode))
;;
;; This does two things: first, it creates autoload for the `ace-jump-mode'
;; command, and defers loading of `ace-jump-mode' until you actually use it.
;; Second, it binds the key `C-.' to that command.  After loading, you can use
;; `M-x describe-personal-keybindings' to see all such bindings you've set
;; throughout your Emacs.
;;
;; A more literal way to do the exact same thing is:
;;
;;   (use-package ace-jump-mode
;;     :commands ace-jump-mode
;;     :init
;;     (bind-key "C-." 'ace-jump-mode))
;;
;; When you use the `:commands' keyword, it creates autoloads for those
;; commands and defers loading of the module until they are used.  In this
;; case, the `:init' form is always run -- even if ace-jump-mode might not be
;; on your system.  So remember to keep `:init' activities to only those that
;; would succeed either way.
;;
;; Similar to `:bind', you can use `:mode' and `:interpreter' to establish a
;; deferred binding within `auto-mode-alist' and `interpreter-mode-alist'.
;; The specifier to either keyword can be a single cons or a list:
;;
;;   (use-package python-mode
;;     :mode ("\\.py$" . python-mode)
;;     :interpreter ("python" . python-mode))
;;
;; If you aren't using `:commands', `:bind', `:mode', or `:interpreter' (all
;; of which imply `:commands'), you can still defer loading with the `:defer'
;; keyword:
;;
;;   (use-package ace-jump-mode
;;     :defer t
;;     :init
;;     (progn
;;       (autoload 'ace-jump-mode "ace-jump-mode" nil t)
;;       (bind-key "C-." 'ace-jump-mode)))
;;
;; This does exactly the same thing as the other two commands above.
;;
;; A companion to the `:init' keyword is `:config'.  Although `:init' always
;; happens in the case of deferred modules (which are likely to be the most
;; common kind), `:config' form only run after the module has been loaded by
;; Emacs:
;;
;;   (use-package ace-jump-mode
;;     :bind ("C-." . ace-jump-mode)
;;     :config
;;     (message "Yay, ace-jump-mode was actually loaded!"))
;;
;; You will see a "Configured..." message in your `*Messages*' log when a
;; package is configured, and a timing if the configuration time was longer
;; than 0.01s.  You should keep `:init' forms as simple as possible, and put
;; as much as you can get away with on the `:config' side.
;;
;; You can have both `:init' and `:config':
;;
;;   (use-package haskell-mode
;;     :commands haskell-mode
;;     :init
;;     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.l?hs$" . haskell-mode))
;;     :config
;;     (progn
;;       (use-package inf-haskell)
;;       (use-package hs-lint)))
;;
;; In this case, I want to autoload the command `haskell-mode' from
;; "haskell-mode.el", add it to `auto-mode-alist' at the time ".emacs" is
;; loaded, but wait until after I've opened a Haskell file before loading
;; "inf-haskell.el" and "hs-lint.el".
;;
;; Another similar option to `:init' is `:idle'. Like `:init' this always run,
;; however, it does so when Emacs is idle at some time in the future after
;; load. This is particularly useful for convienience minor modes which can be
;; slow to load. For instance, in this case, I want Emacs to always use
;; `global-pabbrev-mode'. `:commands' creates an appropriate autoload; `:idle'
;; will run this command at some point in the future. If you start Emacs and
;; beginning typing straight-away, loading will happen eventually.
;;
;; (use-package pabbrev
;;   :commands global-pabbrev-mode
;;   :idle (global-pabbrev-mode))
;;
;; Idle functions are run in the order in which they are evaluated. If you
;; have many, it may take sometime for all to run. `use-package' will always
;; tell you if there is an error in the form which can otherwise be difficult
;; to debug. It may tell you about functions being eval'd, depending on the
;; value of `use-package-verbose'. Other good candidates for `:idle' are
;; `yasnippet', `auto-complete' and `autopair'.
;;
;; The `:bind' keyword takes either a cons or a list of conses:
;;
;;   (use-package hi-lock
;;     :bind (("M-o l" . highlight-lines-matching-regexp)
;;            ("M-o r" . highlight-regexp)
;;            ("M-o w" . highlight-phrase)))
;;
;; The `:commands' keyword likewise takes either a symbol or a list of
;; symbols.
;;
;; You can use the `:if' keyword to predicate the loading and initialization
;; of a module.  For example, I only want an `edit-server' running for my
;; main, graphical Emacs, not for Emacsen I may start at the command line:
;;
;;   (use-package edit-server
;;     :if window-system
;;     :init
;;     (progn
;;       (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'server-start t)
;;       (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'edit-server-start t)))
;;
;; The `:disabled' keyword can be used to turn off a module that you're having
;; difficulties with, or to stop loading something you're not really using at
;; the present time:
;;
;;   (use-package ess-site
;;     :disabled t
;;     :commands R)
;;
;; Another feature of `use-package' is that it always loads every file that it
;; can when your ".emacs" is being byte-compiled (if you do that, which I
;; recommend).  This helps to silence spurious warnings about unknown
;; variables and functions.
;;
;; However, there are times when this is just not enough.  For those times,
;; use the `:defines' keyword to introduce empty variable definitions solely
;; for the sake of the byte-compiler:
;;
;;   (use-package texinfo
;;     :defines texinfo-section-list
;;     :commands texinfo-mode
;;     :init
;;     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.texi$" . texinfo-mode)))
;;
;; If you need to silence a missing function warning, do it with an autoload
;; stub in your `:init' block:
;;
;;   (use-package w3m
;;     :commands (w3m-browse-url w3m-session-crash-recovery-remove)
;;     :init
;;     (eval-when-compile
;;       (autoload 'w3m-search-escape-query-string "w3m-search")))
;;
;; If your package needs a directory added to the `load-path' in order load,
;; use `:load-path'.  It takes a string or a list of strings.  If the path is
;; relative, it will be expanded within `user-emacs-directory':
;;
;;   (use-package ess-site
;;     :disabled t
;;     :load-path "site-lisp/ess/lisp/"
;;     :commands R)
;;
;; Lastly, `use-package' provides built-in support for the diminish utility,
;; if you have that installed.  It's purpose is to remove strings from your
;; mode-line that would otherwise always be there and provide no useful
;; information.  It is invoked with the `:diminish' keyword, which is passed
;; either the minor mode symbol, a cons of the symbol and a replacement string,
;; or just a replacement string in which case the minor mode symbol is guessed
;; to be the package name with "-mode" at the end:
;;
;;   (use-package abbrev
;;     :diminish abbrev-mode
;;     :init
;;     (if (file-exists-p abbrev-file-name)
;;         (quietly-read-abbrev-file))
;;
;;     :config
;;     (add-hook 'expand-load-hook
;;               (lambda ()
;;                 (add-hook 'expand-expand-hook 'indent-according-to-mode)
;;                 (add-hook 'expand-jump-hook 'indent-according-to-mode))))
;;
;; If you noticed that this declaration has neither a `:bind', `:commands' or
;; `:defer' keyword: congratulations, you're an A student!  What it means is
;; that both the `:init' and `:config' forms will be executed when ".emacs" is
;; loaded, with no delays until later.  Is this useful?  Not really.  I just
;; happen to like separating my configuration into things that must happen at
;; startup time, and things that could potentioally wait until after the
;; actual load.  In this case, everything could be put inside `:init' and
;; there would be no difference.
;;
;; * For el-get users
;;
;; You can use `use-package' as a way to create source definitions for el-get.
;; All that's needed is to add a `:type' keyword to your declaration.  When
;; this is present, certain keywords get translated to what el-get expects in
;; the `el-get-sources' list:
;;
;;   :config   -> :after
;;   :requires -> :depends
;;
;; A `:name' will be added also, if one is not provided explicitly, which will
;; be the same as the name of the package.
;;
;; But why would you want to use `use-package' when you have el-get?  My
;; answer is that I'd like to use el-get to install and update some packages,
;; but I don't want it managing configuration.  Just loading el-get -- without
;; call (el-get 'sync) -- takes a quarter second on my machine.  That's 25% of
;; my load time!  `use-package' is designed for performance, so I only want to
;; load el-get when it's time to install or update on of my used packages.
;;
;; Here is the `use-package' declaration I use for setting up el-get, but only
;; when I want to install or update:
;;
;;   (defvar el-get-sources nil)
;;
;;   (use-package el-get
;;     :commands (el-get
;;                el-get-install
;;                el-get-update
;;                el-get-list-packages)
;;     :config
;;     (defun el-get-read-status-file ()
;;       (mapcar #'(lambda (entry)
;;                   (cons (plist-get entry :symbol)
;;                         `(status "installed" recipe ,entry)))
;;               el-get-sources)))
