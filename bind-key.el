;;; Commentary:

;; If you have lots of keybindings set in your .emacs file, it can be hard to
;; know which ones you haven't set yet, and which may now be overriding some
;; new default in a new Emacs version.  This module aims to solve that
;; problem.
;;
;; Bind keys as follows in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'bind-key)
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command)
;;
;; If you want the keybinding to override all minor modes that may also bind
;; the same key, use the `bind-key*' form:
;;
;;   (bind-key* "<C-return>" 'other-window)
;;
;; If you want to rebind a key only in a particular key, use:
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; To unbind a key within a keymap (for example, to stop your favorite major
;; mode from changing a binding that you don't want to override everywhere),
;; use `unbind-key':
;;
;;   (unbind-key "C-c x" some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; After Emacs loads, you can see a summary of all your personal keybindings
;; currently in effect with this command:
;;
;;   M-x describe-personal-keybindings
;;
;; This display will tell you if you've overriden a default keybinding, and
;; what the default was.  Also, it will tell you if the key was rebound after
;; your binding it with `bind-key', and what it was rebound it to.
