;;; Commentary:

;; If you have lots of keybindings set in your .emacs file, it can be hard to
;; know which ones you haven't set yet, and which may now be overriding some
;; new default in a new emacs version.  This module aims to solve that
;; problem.
;;
;; Bind keys as follows in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'bind-key)
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command)
;;
;; If the keybinding argument is a vector, it is passed straight to
;; `define-key', so remapping a key with `[remap COMMAND]' works as
;; expected:
;;
;;   (bind-key [remap original-ctrl-c-x-command] 'my-ctrl-c-x-command)
;;
;; If you want the keybinding to override all minor modes that may also bind
;; the same key, use the `bind-key*' form:
;;
;;   (bind-key* "<C-return>" 'other-window)
;;
;; If you want to rebind a key only in a particular keymap, use:
;;
;;   (bind-key "C-c x" 'my-ctrl-c-x-command some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; To unbind a key within a keymap (for example, to stop your favorite major
;; mode from changing a binding that you don't want to override everywhere),
;; use `unbind-key':
;;
;;   (unbind-key "C-c x" some-other-mode-map)
;;
;; To bind multiple keys at once, or set up a prefix map, a `bind-keys' macro
;; is provided.  It accepts keyword arguments, please see its documentation
;; for a detailed description.
;;
;; To add keys into a specific map, use :map argument
;;
;;    (bind-keys :map dired-mode-map
;;               ("o" . dired-omit-mode)
;;               ("a" . some-custom-dired-function))
;;
;; To set up a prefix map, use `:prefix-map' and `:prefix' arguments (both are
;; required)
;;
;;    (bind-keys :prefix-map my-customize-prefix-map
;;               :prefix "C-c c"
;;               ("f" . customize-face)
;;               ("v" . customize-variable))
;;
;; You can combine all the keywords together.  Additionally,
;; `:prefix-docstring' can be specified to set documentation of created
;; `:prefix-map' variable.
;;
;; To bind multiple keys in a `bind-key*' way (to be sure that your bindings
;; will not be overridden by other modes), you may use `bind-keys*' macro:
;;
;;    (bind-keys*
;;     ("C-o" . other-window)
;;     ("C-M-n" . forward-page)
;;     ("C-M-p" . backward-page))
;;
;; After Emacs loads, you can see a summary of all your personal keybindings
;; currently in effect with this command:
;;
;;   M-x describe-personal-keybindings
;;
;; This display will tell you if you've overridden a default keybinding, and
;; what the default was.  Also, it will tell you if the key was rebound after
;; your binding it with `bind-key', and what it was rebound it to.

  "Bind KEY-NAME to COMMAND in KEYMAP (`global-map' if not passed).

KEY-NAME may be a vector, in which case it is passed straight to
`define-key'. Or it may be a string to be interpreted as
spelled-out keystrokes, e.g., \"C-c C-z\". See documentation of
`edmacro-mode' for details.

COMMAND must be an interactive function or lambda form.

KEYMAP, if present, should be a keymap variable or symbol.
For example:

  (bind-key \"M-h\" #'some-interactive-function my-mode-map)

  (bind-key \"M-h\" #'some-interactive-function \\='my-mode-map)

If PREDICATE is non-nil, it is a form evaluated to determine when
a key should be bound. It must return non-nil in such cases.
Emacs can evaluate this form at any time that it does redisplay
or operates on menu data structures, so you should write it so it
can safely be called at any time."
